-How do you feel about sharing a bed?
-Oh, man. A little nervy.
-Nervy?
You ever slept with a guy like first day? -I mean -- no.
-I'm definitely not the type to be in the clubs
and to, like, go home with a man.
But I like there to be like a solid connection.
So this is definitely me putting myself out there.
-For sure. I mean, I knew with the kiss on the cheek.
-Ohh! Did your heart kind of drop when l...
-Yeah, no, it was beating like 300... -Really?
-Yeah. -I'm dead, I'm dead.
-That didn't bother you, though,
that I didn't actually kiss you?
-No. Not at all.
I'm praying I get a kiss from Belle-A
sooner rather than later.
The game plan is to talk to the other girls,
get to know them.
But Belle-A is definitely, like,
the front-runner, for me right now.
And I hope she feels the same way.
-You have like a... -Oh, wow.
Thought you just wanted to hold my hand for a second.
[ Laughing ] Grab.
-I don't know, is that, like, too much?
I don't want to, like, jump the gun.
-Dude, hold my hand!
-Laughter
-We're moving at, like, middle-school pace.
-Are we, like, to that -- yeah, to that...
-I'm down to move at middle-school pace.
-Put the hand down and, like...
-Wait, no, that doesn't feel right.
-Yeah. Thank you. I tke that a lot more.
Let's get a little closer.
This is good! Look at us!
Kiss on the cheek. Little cuddle. [ Laughs ]
