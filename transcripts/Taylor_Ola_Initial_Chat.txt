-If you could build a woman, what does she look like?
-Alright, so we got top -- good teeth.
You know, which you got. - Okay.
You know, big butt.
Okay. And good toes, bro. You gotta have good toe--
-Don't look at my feet. They swollen!
-Yeah. They almost... -They not bad.
-They almost jumped at me now.
Keep ‘em -- keep ‘em down. -I can't wait to see yours.
-I do got one black toe. A horse stepped on my foot.
-Oh, my God! -Yes.
I just have a black knot on my toe. -Now it's fungus.
-Dontt do that, ‘cause my shit ain't fungus.
-[ Laughing ] -I ain't never...
I get pedicures. Hey, come on now.
-You're funny. Like, I dead was laughing.
I never laugh at men jokes.
-She finna be a bully, bro. -Facts.
-What you looking for, like, Ina guy? Yeah.
-I'm the really only Southern belle,
so I'm just like, I love a country man.
I love a cowboy, I love this, I love that.
And boom, you walk in with a cowboy hat.
I'm just like... -I'm a good guy.
-So when you walked in, I'm like, "Oh, my God.
This ts literally..."
-God heard you, bruh.
-Honestly, it seems like It's too good to be true.
My own personal cowboy.
I love country men, so we are a perfect match.
Were we made for each other? Well, we'll see.
It's just day one.
lam not trying to be delusional,
but I am liking what I'm seeing so far.
I've been trying the city boy thing
because I moved to Houston three years ago.
Me and city boys just don't seem to mesh well at all.
-Yeah. -I like a man.
A grown-ass man, the one that likes to handle business
all the way around the clock.
You know what I'm saying? Not just financially.
I like a provider and all that stuff,
but the money can come,
but the free shit, that resonates with me
way more than a bill getting paid by man.
-I get that. You know, lopen door for ladies.
-Yeah. -They the first ones in the elevator.
-Yeah. Exactly.
Even when it comes to, like, walking down the sidewalk.
What side you supposed to walk on?
-Side close to the street.
Come on now. -City men don't get it.
They don't understand It.
They don't understand it.
-She from the South, you know?
My mom's the same way.
So it ain't nothing that I'm not used to.
It definitely feels great to be coupled up,
spend the night with her.
We definitely vibe well together.
